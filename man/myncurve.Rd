\title{Plot Normal Distribution Curve, Shade Area, and Display Probability}
\usage{
myncurve(mu, sigma, a)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{Mean of the normal distribution.}

\item{sigma}{Standard deviation of the normal distribution.}

\item{a}{The value up to which the area under the curve is shaded and the probability is calculated.}
}
\value{
A list containing the mean (`mu`), standard deviation (`sigma`), and the cumulative probability (`prob`).
}
\description{
This function plots the normal distribution curve for given mean and standard deviation,
shades the area under the curve from the left up to a specified value, and calculates the
cumulative probability up to that value.
}
\examples{
result <- myncurve(mu = 10, sigma = 5, a = 6)
print(result)
}
